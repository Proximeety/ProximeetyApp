# Proximeety Android Applications

Proximeety is an Android-based social media platform that aims to provide an exclusive communication
channel for people who have met physically in person, such people can be friends or strangers that
share common interests with the user, and there is no other way to friend another user on
Proximeety. The purpose of this restriction is to filter out ineffective/superficial online
communication from Proximeety so that only people who have some kind of real connection in life can
further link up on our app.

As a Proximeety user, one can choose to establish connection with someone they meet face-to-face via
bluetooth, after a connection has been set up, users can message each other and share posts/story
feeds with intended connections. A map feature is also available to users so that they can see other
app users in the local area. One can edit their tags which are visible publicly, in this way other
users who find their tags interesting may have a chance to meet up. The map also keeps track of
where each connection was made, providing a log for users who want to keep track of their social
activities.

Each contributer must test their merge thoroughly on the local side, a pull request will only be
approved after review and testing done by at least 2 others. Integrated testing should be done after
each merge.

Without Internet connection, a user can still view recent message history and posts with cache, a
user can also edit their own files and the changes will be applied once connected to the Internet
again.
